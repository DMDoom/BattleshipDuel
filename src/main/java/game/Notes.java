    /*
    TO DO
    DONE - sprites (explosions) 
    DONE - better collisions with shapes for asteroids
    - randomize board and reset positions on win, add to score counter
    - add 3, 2, 1 counter before start
    - add big asteroid in the middle at start I suppose
    SEMI DONE - optimize movement speed, projectile speed etc.
    - add powerups
    SEMI DONE (no vis eff) - add turbo accelerate on both shifts (instant accelerate boost)
    - menu
    - add trail particles
    
    // POWERUPS
    // Manage them in the ship class
    // Drop from asteroids?
    
    // Speed
    // Shield (change display, immune from enemy fire)
    // Rage (fire shitton of projectiles)
    // Berserk (kill ships and asteroids on contact)
    // Precision (increase projectile speed)
    // Size, less fire rate(increase projectile size) (likely hard to implement)
    // Rail
    
    // If i decide to implement health system instead of one hit kill
    // Heal (+1 hp)
    // Quad damage (insta kill, double shoot asteroids)
    
    // Future development possibilities
    // Different ships
    // Customizable ships (fire rate, projectile speed, health, speed)
