# BattleshipDuel

Basic concept of a one versus one game based on Asteroids. Score points by hitting your opponent while avoiding asteroids. Game ends when either player collides with an asteroid or
scores 10 hits on the opponent. Players may also destroy asteroids, which upon destruction will generate rubble flying towards the opposite direction from where they were shot from.
It is a viable tactic to try to destroy an asteroid in an attempt hit the opponent hiding behind it with rubble, ending the game in a single hit.
